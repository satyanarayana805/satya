PROJECT ON IRIS FLOWER
# Iris Flower Classification

A simple yet powerful machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — using features like petal and sepal length and width. This classic dataset is ideal for beginners to understand the workflow of supervised learning and model deployment.

## Problem Statement

To build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Proposed System

The proposed system uses a machine learning classification algorithm (such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, or Decision Tree) to learn from labeled iris data and predict the species of new iris samples.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Algorithm and Model Development

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
   - Check for null values and data distribution
   - Encode labels if necessary

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Pair plots and correlation heatmaps
   - Histograms and scatter plots to visualize class separation

3. **Model Building**  
   - Split data using `train_test_split`
   - Train using algorithms like:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Support Vector Machine
     - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

4. **Model Deployment (Optional)**  
   - Save model using `joblib` or `pickle`
   - Deploy using Streamlit or Flask for demo app

## Output

Example output:
- Classification Report  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Accuracy Score  
- Prediction for user-given input features

## Result

Achieved an accuracy of over **95%** using basic classifiers like SVM and KNN. The model is able to distinguish between the three iris species with high reliability.

## Future Scope

- Integrate into a web-based application using Streamlit or Flask.
- Enhance model using hyperparameter tuning or ensemble methods.
- Deploy as a REST API or mobile app demo.
